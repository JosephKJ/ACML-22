        <span>Hyderabad rivals Delhi with its collection of gorgeous mosques, minarets, tombs and palaces. Its culture and history remain its biggest attractions. It was founded in the late 16th century by the Qutub Shahi rulers, who shifted their capital to the banks of the Musi river, after a water shortage in Golconda. It was ruled by the Mughals, and from the 18th century onwards, by the Asaf Jah dynasty who called themselves the Nizams of Hyderabad. Under these rulers, Hyderabad became one of the richest cities in India and an important centre of art, culture and education. More recently, as an important technology hub, it has become a city where the past rubs shoulders with the present. </span>
