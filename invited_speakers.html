                          <p>
                              Aarti Singh is a Professor of Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University.
                              She was also the recepient of the A. Nico Habermann Career Development Chair award from 2013-2016. She was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Program in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Princeton University from 2008-2009 before joining Carnegie Mellon. She received her B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the University of Delhi in 2001, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2003 and 2008, respectively. 
                              <br/><br/> Her research goal is to design algorithms that can learn and leverage inherent structure of data in the form of clusters, graphs, subspaces and manifolds to achieve tradeoffs between the competing goals of computational efficiency and statistical optimality (optimal accuracy for a given amount of data). Additionally, she is investigating how these tradeoffs can be further improved by designing interactive algorithms that employ judicious choice of where, what and how data is acquired, stored and processed. The vision is to introduce a new paradigm of intelligent machine learning algorithms that learn continually via feedback and make high-level decisions in collaboration with humans, thus pushing the envelope of automated scientific and social discoveries. Her research has been supported by grants from NSF, AFOSR, and NIH, including NSF CAREER and the AFOSR Young Investigator Award.
